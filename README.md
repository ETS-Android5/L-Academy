## Description of the Project (300 words)

Lâ€™Academy is an application where every student can easily get help from tutors while learning. The system allows any student to become a tutor after successful completion of courses to earn points and meet new friends.

The application involves constant interaction between tutors and students. The tutors obtain points and badges for helping students, and extra points after good feedback.
Learning and teaching enhancement will include badges, achievements, and levels to motivate students and teachers to be involved in the process.
Each student can become a tutor if he passes a certain course with good grades.
Points can be spent on application customisation, profile picture change, and purchasing new courses or getting a discount on them. They also can be spent on books purchase discounts.
Integrate online text and voice chat, where student may ask specific questions and get answers from tutors during lecture or after quiz.
