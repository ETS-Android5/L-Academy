## Description of the Project (300 words)

L’Academy is an application where every student can easily get help from tutors while learning. The system allows any student to become a tutor after successful completion of courses to earn points and meet new friends.

The application involves constant interaction between tutors and students. The tutors obtain points and badges for helping students, and extra points after good feedback.
Learning and teaching enhancement will include badges, achievements, and levels to motivate students and teachers to be involved in the process.
Each student can become a tutor if he passes a certain course with good grades.
Points can be spent on application customisation, profile picture change, and purchasing new courses or getting a discount on them. They also can be spent on books purchase discounts.
Integrate online text and voice chat, where student may ask specific questions and get answers from tutors during lecture or after quiz.

## 3 Most Impactful Features of the Project (with Screenshot and Short Description (150 words))
1. Revolutionary system of interaction between three instances: courses, students, and tutors. Each student can become a tutor and earn points. This would solve the market need in both tutors and good-quality education.
2. The project is made on Android Studio using FirestoreFirebase and Java programming language. This allowed us using object-oriented programming, classes, and inheritance. Also, in FirestoreFirebase we contain all the user information fully protected and confidential. These methods made our application’s work effective and fast.
3. In our system, each student can become a tutor after course completion. To enhance the teaching process, we provide points for their work and online certificates indicating number of tutoring hours that could be very useful during application to university/work
